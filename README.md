## Project Title: Muse360
The main goal of our project was to build a functioning front-end framework attached to a pre-programmed back-end API using **Javascript**, **CSS** and an **React**.
We have achieved this by creating an application for a museum management API to help museums manage their exhibits, artefacts and staff rotas.

### Project Description

#### WHAT OUR APPLICATION DOES:
- Muse360 presents a user-friendly interface right from the Home Page which displays the different management categories: Museums, Exhibits, Artefacts, Staff/Assignments.

- There is a "Home" button to return to the home page and a "Help!" button to access helpful contact info in the navigation bar, alongside an extendable list of links to the different pages.

- For each of the respective object classes there are **CRUD methods**, allowing the user to modify the data held by the API:

- [x] CREATE -> `POST`
- [x] READ -> `GET`
- [x] UPDATE -> `PUT`
- [x] DELETE -> `DELETE`

- We created buttons and forms to facilitate these actions on each page.

- **LIBRARIES**:
- We used a few libraries found from [Material UI](https://mui.com/) including the table feature used for each list of items, and the navigation bar.

#### WHY WE USED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES:
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) : We were able to access a lot of helpful libraries to make our site even more user-friendly.
- [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) : This helped us to visualise our aesthetics before implementing CSS and also allowed us to vet accessibility.

#### CHALLENGES WE FACED:
- Working with **external libraries** was initially pretty tricky as we had to work out how to incorporate the code properly.
- It was pretty hard to get used to working with the front-end as a whole as we collectively had little experience, but we tried our best to research our issues as much as possible before asking for direct help.

#### FEATURES WE HOPE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE FUTURE:
- Import other libraries for different features (e.g. for forms).

### How to Install + Run the Project
- Git clone the project to your own system
- Open back-end application in IntelliJ and make sure that the it is running
- Open the front-end in VS code and use **npm start** to run and open the application
